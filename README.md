This repository is the homework projects that I did in Data structure course, which I was taken at Université de Montréal. It consists of 3 projects using various data structure. 

### Assignment 1: Card Games

Implement a CardHand class that supports a person arranging a group of cards in his or her hand. The simulator should represent the sequence of cards using a single positional list ADT (use the one that developed in the class) so that cards of the same suit are kept together.


### Assignment 2: Music Streaming
I got maximum score on this assignment.

Develop a music streaming application. One of the features is a play queue (referred to later as the playlist), much like Spotify's, where the songs that have been queued will automatically play. Various Trees based, and Maps are used in this project.

### Assignment 3: 
Implement our own dictionary which more advance features than the traditional one. TRIE data structure has been used in this project.
